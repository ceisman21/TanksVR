# TanksVR
This Project is to be run in Unity, which can be downloaded from https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
All plugins needed are included within the files of this git, Including the Oculus VR Implementation. However, use of Oculus Experimental Features requires an Oculus Device, and enabling of "Expieriemental Features" which can be found in Oculus Settings under "Extras"

# Bugs
At the moment, there are quite a bit of issues integrating the user within the moving object, the vbehicle. Any continuing support should be focus on "attaching" the user to the vehicle. Additionally, The Levers can often lead to a bit ofg turmoil when maniuplated too far, and this should also be looked into.
